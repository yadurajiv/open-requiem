What started as some experiments for a presentation grew slightly bigger into something else. My initial ideas were to maybe make it into a small Oekaki Program like Shi Painter or ChibiPaint or PaintBBS.. Since I remember taking part in some online paintbbs action long time ago.. and it was fun.. and simple.. and just doodling awesomeness.. Those Oekaki programs are mostly in java or flash.. Most of the canvas experiments out there are far from useful.. they are just canvas experiments.. I just wanted to make something good looking and usable.. a small alternative free paint program.. supporting multiple brushes.. layers.. history.. effects(?), basic tools like fill, gradients, paint, primitives, selection, move, crop etc.. + possibly exporting/importing ur finished work into open formats like the ORA so that you can always edit it later in MyPaint or GIMP(with a plugin for OpenRaster). Most of these things that I've mentioned are doable and I'm planning out to do them as well. There is a small road map for things.. very basic.. Apart from being a canvas playground, this was supposed to be a UI/UX experiment as well with some weird ideas for popups and tools.. I'm using JqueryUI for now.. I'm trying everything I can to keep the interface from polluting the drawing core of the app. Thats about it for now.
